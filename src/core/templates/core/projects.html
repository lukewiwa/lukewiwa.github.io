            <p>
                A website backed by an AWS Lambda function and S3. The functionality is
                pretty simple, input an image file and it should spit out an animated
                gif with an overlay of a flickering fire. This was an experiment in how
                I could shove django into a lambda function white stripping away as much
                of the django functionality as possible. Django here is <em>almost</em>
                stateless. The function relies on a sqlite database that is largely used
                as go between to easily keep track of the gif file and to generate an
                endpoint to show the processed gif. The source is available on
                <a href="https://github.com/lukewiwa/set-fire-to-emoji">github</a>.

            <p>
                A browser extension that does exactly one thing, adds an item to the
                context menu that will open the current tab in a new private window. I
                use this to get around soft paywalls. Available at the
                <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/privatise/kfconhabclnbnnjaapmdhnacnlonhgkl">

                A web game using client side tesseract and notepad libraries. It's
                frustratingly fun.

            <p>
                If you have a PWA installed on android you can register it as a
                <a href="https://web.dev/web-share-target/">share target</a>. For
                debugging purposes this PWA allows you to see exactly what type of data
                will be transferred through the share intent. Add this site to your
                homescreen from android chrome and then from any android app share to
                this PWA to reveal the data being transferred.

            <p>
                I wanted a machine readable code of points so I created a scraper with
                python and pulled out the relevant information. The most up to date
                version is available on github. Feel free to find any faults and send
                pull requests, due to the fickle nature of pdf scraping and my lack of
                experience coding there are bound to be errors.
