title: MAG Code Of Points 2020
gymnastics: true
excerpt: I wanted a machine readable code of points so I created a scraper with python and pulled out the relevant information. The most up to date version is available on github. Feel free to find any faults and send pull requests, due to the fickle nature of pdf scraping and my lack of experience coding there are bound to be errors.
