If longevity is an argument then this may be borne out in the statistics themselves. <em>There are problems, however with this as the minimum age restriction got bumped up to 18 for WAG recently</em> <strong>Update: I have been reminded this was only on the MAG side.</strong> Not an insurmountable problem however for statisticians.</p><h2>Single Data Point Arguments</h2><p>I’ve heard through the grapevine that a justification for keeping with 10 counting skills was put forward because of the unique situation at Glasgow World Championships where Uneven Bars had a four way tie for first place. The argument follows that this would not happen in a 10 counting skill system. Now this argument could easily be backed up with a little data analysis. Have we had a sudden increase in tie situations in WAG competitions since the introduction of 8 counting skills? This would be fairly easy to justify either way by simply checking back on major competitions and comparing the rate of tied scores before and after the change. <strong>One data point does not an argument make</strong>.</p><h1>Conclusions</h1><p>Without any analysis no real conclusions can be drawn. I’m sure there are many ways to manipulate the data. There are also many smarter people out there who could get more out of the data than I ever could and the FIG and MTC should be embracing these possibilities. I for one would be happy to stay with 10 counting skills or move to 8 if there was something, anything, concrete the FIG and MTC could hang their hat on but so far I am left underwhelmed. Who knows, perhaps some analysis has been done and I am ignorant of it, if so feel free to point me towards it. I really hope that I am wrong.</p></div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">window.__CSS_CHUNKS__ = {"main":"https://lukewiwa.com/styles.1f002e3f.css"}</script><script type="text/javascript">

This eliminates the bias towards 8 counting skills having a higher execution score as would happen if the analysis were to be done per routine.\n\nA more basic measure would be to calculate the rate of falls per routine or per skill to see whether, on average, 8 counting skills correlates with less falls. These kind of statistics would, at the least, provide some evidence to support arguments concerning the quality of routines after the changes.\n\n## Average Participation Age\n\nHas the average or median participant age increased for major competitions around the World? If longevity is an argument then this may be borne out in the statistics themselves. _There are problems, however with this as the minimum age restriction got bumped up to 18 for WAG recently_ **Update: I have been reminded this was only on the MAG side.** Not an insurmountable problem however for statisticians.\n\n## Single Data Point Arguments\n\nI’ve heard through the grapevine that a justification for keeping with 10 counting skills was put forward because of the unique situation at Glasgow World Championships where Uneven Bars had a four way tie for first place. The argument follows that this would not happen in a 10 counting skill system. Now this argument could easily be backed up with a little data analysis. Have we had a sudden increase in tie situations in WAG competitions since the introduction of 8 counting skills? This would be fairly easy to justify either way by simply checking back on major competitions and comparing the rate of tied scores before and after the change. **One data point does not an argument make**.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nWithout any analysis no real conclusions can be drawn. I’m sure there are many ways to manipulate the data. There are also many smarter people out there who could get more out of the data than I ever could and the FIG and MTC should be embracing these possibilities. I for one would be happy to stay with 10 counting skills or move to 8 if there was something, anything, concrete the FIG and MTC could hang their hat on but so far I am left underwhelmed. Who knows, perhaps some analysis has been done and I am ignorant of it, if so feel free to point me towards it. I really hope that I am wrong.","data":{"title":"The “We Say You Do” Model Of Code Review Is Broken","slug":"broken_code_review","layout":"simple_page","date":"24/02/2016","teaser":"With the review and rehash of the Code of Points for the 2017–2020 cycle one thing is becoming increasingly clear, the FIG and requisite technical committees should do as students are told to do and show their working.
