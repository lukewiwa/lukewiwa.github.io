I thought it was time to step away from Vue and try something new, partly out of curiosity and partly because I really like JSX as a templating language. And frankly I'm just not really up for the migration from Vue 2 to Vue 3.</p>

<p>This site is now generated using <a href="https://lumeland.github.io/">lume</a>. Lume is a static site generator built on top of the <a href="https://deno.land">Deno</a> programming language. I've been somewhat enamoured with Deno when it came out. It's pretty fantastic to download a single binary and it's got everything I need for compilation, formatting and typechecking.</p>
<p>I've used Deno for a few small scripts (which I think it excels at) and I wanted to get into a deeper project with it. Additionally I love JSX as a templating language and was wondering whether there was anything out there that would build static web sites using it. I mean particularly calling the <code>renderToStaticMarkup</code> method in react at build time and leaving just HTML files to serve. I wanted to steer clear of tools like Gatsby and Next.js, just pure HTML in the end.</p>
<p>Well turns out lume really scratched that itch. It's a neat little framework and suits my needs ok. I do enjoy using TailwindCSS but found no clear way to install it using Deno so I ended up using TachyonsCSS which covers similar ground.</p>
<p>I've also added <a href="https://newcss.net/">new.css</a> for base styles because I'm lazy. It turns out it has a dark mode which I'm not in love with but I'll take it and hopefully finally learn the particulars of detecting dark mode preferences.</p>
<p>So enjoy the different colour scheme, point out the inconsistency in styles and subscribe to my <a href="/feed/blog/rss.xml">rss</a> which I'm sure I borked somehow.</p>
