I have tried a few different iterations of personal websites and of online publishing in the past. Although I will still publish random thoughts on my favourite social media sites and longer thoughts tend to find their way to [medium](https://medium.com/@lukewiwa) this platform might be a nice dumping ground for a few things. Mainly I intend for this to become a landing page for some personal projects and also a better place to leave more personal or technical ramblings.
