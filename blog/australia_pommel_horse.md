There is something so wrong and rigid about how we teach pommel horse in Australia.

In contrast we seem to be so savvy and inventive when it comes to high bar or even floor. Our "middle class" routines are adequate and serviceable.

Sure we had Prashanth and now Jesse but where are our all around stalwarts getting solid mid 13s?

I'm telling on myself here. Quite obvious that pommel was my worst. Part of me reckons with a coach that thought a little more outside the box we could've gotten a lot more out of me on that apparatus.

Last aimless thought. Whatever has worked for us on high bar needs to be bottled up somehow and applied to pommel.

Some nations have achieved this. GB and Brazil are good recent examples.
