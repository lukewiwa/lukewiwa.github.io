I decided to use the [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/docs/0.12/) framework as opposed to [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/) since I've always liked the lightness of Bottle and my little app has no need for scaling.\n\nFlask and Bottle seem have much the same features but there's one pattern in particular that is done easily in Flask but wasn't obvious in Bottle. In many flask tutorials a simple redirect to a url, usually after an authentication seems easily done.\n\nIn Flask it's basically implemented like this:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import route, redirect, url_for\n\n@route('/')\ndef root():\n    return 'home'\n\n@route('/redirected')\ndef redirected():\n    return redirect(url_for('root'))\n```\n\nIn Bottle this can be done with the little documented `url` method, however it works a little bit differently. The route needs to be named using a keyword argument, but then the rest is much the same.\n\n```python\nfrom bottle import route, redirect, url\n\n@route('/', name='home')\ndef root():\n    return 'home'\n\n@route('/redirected')\ndef redirected():\n    return redirect(url('home'))\n```","data":{"title":"Bottle URL Redirect","slug":"bottle_url","layout":"simple_page","date":"23/05/2017","teaser":"The little documented url method in bottle.py"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","path":"blog/bottle_url.md"}}}
