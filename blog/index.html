Financially and in terms of the overall space and hassle a second car would occupy in our lives. In essence we didn't really need two cars, we sort of needed a car and a half. I'd been hearing good things about cargo bikes and their potential as a family vehicle. So we took a punt on buying one. It's been in our possession for over a year now and has done over 3000km in that time. In short it's been a fantastic investment for us on several axes: financial, fitness, health and overall wellbeing.</p></div></section><section class="pb2"><h1 class="f3"><a href="/blog/end_multi_arch_manylinux2014_builds/">End of lukewiwa/manylinux2014 Container Image Builds</a></h1><time class="db gray mb1">2025-03-24</time><div><p>I previously created a <a href="https://github.com/lukewiwa/manylinux2014">github repo</a> to amalgamate the different architectural builds of <code>manylinux2014</code> into a multi architectural manifest.

There are a few advantages but at the end of the day it's cheaper, allows for global caching at the edge and provides a fairly straight forward way to obtain SSL certificates. In my own hosting of apps I will more often than not use API gateway in front of Django too as this gives you some nice tools such as rate limiting and whatnot. But it seems really annoying and difficult to get it all working with a Django app given Django's security model around the allowed hosts.</p></div></section><section class="pb2"><h1 class="f3"><a href="/blog/django_on_aws_for_chump_change/">Django on AWS for Chump Change</a></h1><time class="db gray mb1">2024-11-21</time><div><p>Below are the resources to my PyConAU 2024 talk "Django on AWS for Chump Change"</p></div></section><section class="pb2"><h1 class="f3"><a href="/blog/pocket_notebook/">Pocket Notebook</a></h1><time class="db gray mb1">2024-09-28</time><div><p>I've tried a lot of productivity software over the years.

In days gone by I would have run these in a cron job on a server somewhere but as I've gotten into the weeds of AWS infrastructure I've leant on some AWS services more for these little personal conveniences. My preference nowadays is to use AWS Lambda as my first point of call and integrate other services as I need them. I'm very confident that AWS won't be deprecating their Lambda platform and they connect well to Cloudwatch, meaning I don't have to worry about creating a logging solution. Additionally now that I'm pretty confident with the AWS CDK for spinning up infrastructure it's a breeze to connect other services to assist with any other needs. Today I'll go through one example which provided a flexible and <strong>cheap</strong> solution to my problem.</p></div></section><section class="pb2"><h1 class="f3"><a href="/blog/guitar_tabs_fortune_teller/">Fortune Teller by Xavier Rudd - Guitar Tabs</a></h1><time class="db gray mb1">2022-01-22</time><div><p>There are no good tabs for this track online so I finally figured it out and created them.</p></div></section><section class="pb2"><h1 class="f3"><a href="/blog/multiple_pythons_docker_image/">Docker Image With Multiple Python Installs</a></h1><time class="db gray mb1">2021-05-26</time><div><p>Not sure whether this has been done before but I created a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/lukewiwa/pythons">docker container with four (4) Python installs</a>.
