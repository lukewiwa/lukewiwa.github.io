There is however a pain point which is admittedly not a conventional use case but a possible use case none the less. Django supports a version of sqlite that is above the current version supported on the underlying operating systems of the AWS python lambda implementation. If you're interested lambda functions run on Amazon Linux 1 and 2 which are based on CentOS 6 and 7 respectively.</p></div></section><section class="pb2"><h3><a href="/blog/another_refresh/">Another Fresh Lick Of Paint</a></h3><time class="db gray mb1">2022-02-19</time><div><p>I finally found the time and space to do my semi regular migration to a new static site generator.

In days gone by I would have run these in a cron job on a server somewhere but as I've gotten into the weeds of AWS infrastructure I've leant on some AWS services more for these little personal conveniences. My preference nowadays is to use AWS Lambda as my first point of call and integrate other services as I need them. I'm very confident that AWS won't be deprecating their Lambda platform and they connect well to Cloudwatch, meaning I don't have to worry about creating a logging solution. Additionally now that I'm pretty confident with the AWS CDK for spinning up infrastructure it's a breeze to connect other services to assist with any other needs. Today I'll go through one example which provided a flexible and <strong>cheap</strong> solution to my problem.</p></div></section><section class="pb2"><h3><a href="/blog/guitar_tabs_fortune_teller/">Fortune Teller by Xavier Rudd - Guitar Tabs</a></h3><time class="db gray mb1">2022-01-22</time><div><p>There are no good tabs for this track online so I finally figured it out and created them.</p></div></section><section class="pb2"><h3><a href="/blog/multiple_pythons_docker_image/">Docker Image With Multiple Python Installs</a></h3><time class="db gray mb1">2021-05-26</time><div><p>Not sure whether this has been done before but I created a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/lukewiwa/pythons">docker container with four (4) Python installs</a>.

It left such a mark on us that it became a frequent topic of conversation when meeting for family events as adults. We described it with such disdain that our friends and significant others seemed sceptical as to how bad it could be.
