We also got married in the intervening years between us being on Centrelink regularly and now, and she subsequently decided to take my last name after our marriage. This has caused a headache linking accounts in her MyGov account since the information doesn't match and the system refuses to move forward. We eventually found a solution after tearing our hair out. I thought I would leave it here for any other lost souls who need this guidance.</p>

<p>Unlink all your accounts! This will allow you to link your Centrelink account. Yes you will have to relink your other accounts if you wish but this is probably a small price to pay versus being on hold with Centrelink for an interminably long amount of time.</p>
