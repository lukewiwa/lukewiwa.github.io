I recently was in need of a quick utility that could translate the session times of the recent Gymnastics World Championships, being held in Doha, into my own timezone. I also thought this was a problem that more people probably had so I started thinking about the quickest, easiest and cheapest way to share that utility with others.\n\nJust by shear chance that I work mostly on Python and Javascript projects, and deciding I needed to brush up on my React skills I chose a Single Page App as my distribution method of choice. So I rolled up my sleeves and built a [web app that did just that](https://lukewiwa.com/dohagym2018).\n\nMuch as I've wanted to expand into learning a bit of Android development, on this occasion my lack of knowledge and time constraints pushed me towards the languages and platforms that I already know. What is abundantly clear though is that targeting the web, even as a Single Page App with heavy JavaScript, clearly hits that sweet spot of development time, availability and cost.\n\n# Advantages\n\n## Development Time\n\nJavascript is ugly as hell but with modern JavaScript libraries like React and Vue, among others, and their requisite cli commands for bootstrapping a boilerplate app, developing for the current web is pretty nice in the scheme of things. It's easy to iterate, there are plenty of resources out there to help with most issues and there is a metric tonne of helper libraries and components just a quick NPM install away. It truly is a matter of gluing a few pieces together.\n\n## Availability\n\nNothing has more reach than the Web at this point in time. No app store or packaged app is anywhere near as easy as to share as a URL with anybody and everybody. Additionally there is no wait times for app auditing or to register as a developer. There are dozens of services that will host your static files.\n\n## Cost\n\nNot only are there dozens of static hosting services but the vast majority of them are free. No registration fees, plenty don't even ask for a credit card number. I was amazed at how simple it is to push a bunch of static files up to a service and grab a URL.\n\n# Disadvantages\n\n## Monetisation\n\nCharging for Web Apps, especially small, single purpose utility ones is notoriously hard to do. This is the strength of an App Store where the user is more conditioned to pay for an app (although I'm not so sure about that anymore). I didn't need to monetise my app but if you do care about pulling in a bit of spare change perhaps the current web isn't your best bet.\n\n## Further Building\n\nIf you ever get to the point where you need to start building more features on top of your app or you start needing a database to back it then you are looking at a bit of rebuilding and rethinking your strategy.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAll in all I was pretty happy that I could build a utility that did exactly what I needed in pretty quick time, and that I could share with the world easily and freely.\n","data":{"title":"JavaScript Remains The Best Deployment Target","slug":"ease_of_deployment","layout":"simple_page","date":"10/11/2018","teaser":"It is abundantly clear that targeting the web, even as a Single Page App with heavy JavaScript, hits that sweet spot of development time, availability and cost."},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","path":"blog/ease_of_deployment.md"},{"content":"\r\nMy siblings and I, when growing up, had a VHS tape of Pinocchio which we would watch on occasion.

I was fascinated to study the psychology of how people in general accept certain designs. For better or worse here's an essay which I wrote answering the question \"Does Driving Performance Degrade Or Improve With Increased Automation\".*\r\n\r\nHow is driving performance affected by the introduction of automated systems? It appears the answer is more complex than a simple more or less. There has been increased research into the automation of the tasks involved with driving (Cottrell &amp; Barton, 2013; Merat &amp; Lee, 2012). Coupled with this there is increased study into how these automation’s affect the driver of the vehicle and the safety and reliability of the car in general. Adoption of these automation systems is very much dependant on the willingness of the general driving population to use them (Cottrell &amp; Barton, 2013; Merat &amp; Lee, 2012) and how they interact with the system (Carsten, Lai, Barnard, Jamson, &amp; Merat, 2012; Larsson, 2012; Young &amp; Stanton, 2002; Muhrer, Reinprecht, &amp; Vollrath, 2012). In that sense human factors in driving automation is an important area of study. It can be argued that driving performance increases up to the point of the confines that the automated system works under, however as the system fails and control of the vehicle is handed over to the driver driving performance degrades to a point greater than manual operation.\r\n\r\nWhat is automation and how is it implemented? Driving and operating a vehicle is a complex task which involves many physical and cognitive tasks, often times concurrently (Carsten et al., 2012). Automation systems aim to control a selection of these tasks, or even sometimes all of these tasks, thereby relieving the driver of some cognitive load and increasing the driving performance of the vehicle. The primary tasks of driving can be broken down into longitudinal and latitudinal patterns (Carsten et al., 2012), which basically mean the throttling and steering respectively. As such there has been an effort to cut away some of these tasks and subtasks by using automated systems. These automated systems often look to take care of mundane or repetitive tasks which would allow the driver to concentrate on the higher level tasks associated with operating a vehicle (Larsson, 2012).\r\n\r\nA lower level automation system is the automation of a single task which can be coupled with warning systems. Such an example is the forward collision warning (FCW) and forward collision warning plus braking system (FCW+) (Muhrer et al., 2012). This system indicates to a driver that he/she should take action to avoid a forward collision, the plus braking component initiates the braking for the driver in the event of an imminent collision. This system also gives both visual and audio cues in an increasingly attention grabbing sequence to indicate the threat of collision. Additionally it can also be turned off by the driver allowing full manual control.\r\n\r\nSome higher level examples include the, already commercially available Active Cruise Control (ACC) and Active Braking (AB), automated lane keeping and automated highway driving (Larsson, 2012; Muhrer et al., 2012). These automation systems operate in different ways and have different visual and auditory cues depending on the task. In the case of ACC it is engaged by the driver of the vehicle and has a visual cue on the dashboard to indicate that the system is running. The system works in tandem with the driver rather than taking over an entire task. To deactivate there are several ways, the driver can simply hit the brakes, or turn it off at the control point or the system will disengage itself when outside its boundaries of use (Larsson, 2012).\r\n\r\nIn some circumstances however there has been a focused push on automating the entire vehicle and taking the control away from the driver to the point of simply being an observer rather than an active participant in the operation of the vehicle, the so called ”driverless car” (Merat &amp; Lee, 2012). In this circumstance the driver does not have any role and the system makes all the decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy does automation matter and what are the advantages? Automation from a high level is seen as an improvement to the current limitations of manual operation of a vehicle. The advantages include increased sensitivity to road and traffic conditions (Muhrer et al., 2012), more efficiency and better assistance and comfort to drivers, especially with low driving skills (Merat &amp; Lee, 2012). Automation is also proposed as a solution to reducing congestion by increasing road capacity (Merat &amp; Lee, 2012). In addition to these advantages automation systems allow the abstraction away of mundane or low level tasks allowing access to vehicle driving to a wider population. Ultimately the entire automation of the vehicle could possibly allow huge advantages to many people. These can include the accessibility to driving a large population that previously couldn’t. This includes the disabled, such as blind or physically incapable of driving, will have a level of mobility not previously accessible to them. For all these reasons automation is a sought after technology by car manufacturers and as such can require intense human factors study.\r\n\r\nSome more specific advantages can be seem in human factors studies. Within the limitations of the automation systems they are extremely effective and reduce risk on the road (Muhrer et al., 2012). Automated systems have distinct advantages to human drivers. Some include the inability of automated systems to get distracted, automated systems use sensors which is outside the scope of human senses and automated systems sense multidirectionally. Automated systems also are able to carry out several tasks at once which humans struggle at. In addition to this the reaction time of automated systems are well above that of the average driver (Muhrer et al., 2012). Additionally automated systems do not suffer from fatigue, meaning they stay much more resilient than regular drivers.\r\n\r\nWhat are the potential drawbacks of these automated systems? As automation increases there come some drawbacks which can affect the adoption and safety of these systems. One drawback is the edge cases and limitations of the system for which it was not designed for. A good example of this is for automatic throttling (ACC) the systems forward radar loses contact with the forward car due to a sharp bend in the road (Larsson, 2012). As the system starts to reach its operating limits the system has to make a decision as to when to fail and also how to fail and hand back control to the driver (Merat &amp; Lee, 2012). At the system limitations the system has to be intelligent enough to know when and how to do this otherwise it remains a bad system. Additionally automated systems suffer from another seemingly widespread drawback, that is that with increased automation the awareness of the driver drops and increases the reaction time, and therefore risk, in situations where the system fails and the driver has to take over operation of the vehicle (Cottrell &amp; Barton, 2013; Merat &amp; Lee, 2012; Young &amp; Stanton, 2002). Although countering the last point, if the driver is given more time and education with the system to learn its limitations and quirks, the reaction times and acceptance increases reducing the risk in the changeover of control (Larsson, 2012). This can be demonstrated by (Larsson, 2012) that as time and experience with the ACC increases the driver is more aware of the limitations and the situations in which ACC fails, such as bends and roundabouts, and therefore the awareness in these situations increases.\r\n\r\nThere is also another argument that many of these automated systems can be disparate and piecemeal which can hinder education and acceptance of these automated systems (Merat &amp; Lee, 2012).\r\n\r\nAnother interesting drawback is if the system is only a warning system than the drivers reaction time may decrease even with the warnings in place (Muhrer et al., 2012). This is particularly interesting as it indicates a seemingly unique issue of under automation. The system does not take over enough from the driver and hence puts the driver at a larger risk.\r\n\r\nOn top of these drawbacks there is also the a specific human factor drawback of acceptance of the automation systems. As automation systems are introduced to a vehicle it necessitates an adoption by the driver. Acceptance and trust must be given by the driver to the system. This can prove difficult. Often the driver must learn new and different behaviours which creates a barrier to entry. Often times drivers can be slow to learn these new behaviours, sometimes to the point where drivers may give up and not use them (Larsson, 2012). Conversely when the driver learns the behaviours and limitations of an automation system then the acceptance and trust raises (Larsson, 2012). In this particular study as experience with the system increased so did the acceptance of the system.\r\n\r\nHow can we interpret the results of human factors studies and determine how driving performance is affected? So we have automated systems that create a safer and better driving experience within the limitations of the system. But when the limitations are breached there remains a larger risk and loss of driver awareness and reaction time due to the inattention these systems allow (Cottrell &amp; Barton, 2013; Merat &amp; Lee, 2012). We also have a gap of education due to unfamiliarity with the system of the driver and the drivers knowledge of its limitations. However as this education gap is overcome the risk and awareness gap shrink as well (Larsson, 2012). It appears a gap of education is a barrier to entry for the adoption of these vehicle systems and we therefore have a vicious cycle of adoption and awareness of the system limitations. To keep driving performance at a desirable level there seem to be a few strategies in relation to these automated systems. The simplest strategy is to simply not automate the driving of a vehicle at all and keep all the tasks the responsibility of the driver (Muhrer et al., 2012). There are some advantages to this, in that the driver is always in control and always comfortable with the control he/she has of the vehicle. This allows for quicker awareness in emergency situations. Countering this though the more mundane tasks of regular driving can reduce the awareness of the driver to the tasks and subtasks needed for regular operation (Young &amp; Stanton, 2002). This results in higher stress overall but within the confines of an acceptable and sometimes optimal level of stress for the operation of a vehicle (Cottrell &amp; Barton, 2013).\r\n\r\nTo the ultimate conclusion of full automation it seems we eliminate this gap of risk and inattention. If the fully automated car is capable and indeed possibly better than a driver at all the tasks needed for operating a vehicle than the elimination of the driver and thus the gap of inattention and risk driving performance should be completely improved. The only drawback to the driverless car is that acceptance is very low as drivers prefer to have the illusion of control (Merat &amp; Lee, 2012). But to counter this drivers enjoy a more integrated approach to rather than piecemeal implementations of various disparate automation systems (Merat &amp; Lee, 2012), therefore if the driverless car has an appealing automated experience than adoption may well remain high despite the removal of driver control.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are however some points to make about the research and testing currently available. Many of the studies are done within the confines of a simulated environment (Young &amp; Stanton, 2002; Muhrer et al., 2012; Carsten et al., 2012) which is a limitation of the studies. One which possibly must be put up with due to health and safety concerns of undertaking these tests on the open road. It is possible that participants in these tests behave differently in a simulator as opposed to how they act on the open road. One study was able to research drivers in the real world (Larsson, 2012) via a survey. However the sample size remains small with all the respondents electing to pay extra to have the automated system installed, thereby possibly introducing some confirmation bias into the study results. The final two papers (Cottrell &amp; Barton, 2013; Merat &amp; Lee, 2012) being meta analyses of various papers the conclusions drawn can be trustworthy provided the papers these analyses have drawn from are reliable. So it is clear that more than just these papers must be taken into account for a more rigorous understanding of drivers reaction to automation and how this affects performance on the road.\r\n\r\nThe overall takeaway from these studies can be as follows. Under the management of an automated system driving performance improves. Sometimes it even improves significantly. However when the system fails or returns control to the driver there is a period of time where driving performance degrades to a point lower than with manual operation. After this period performance is restored. There seems to an antidote to this problem, with increased education and familiarity this gulf of performance can be overcome. The challenge is to implement more standardised systems which cultivate familiarity and keep the driver educated about these systems and their quirks and limitations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion using automation systems to take over driving tasks has many advantages and car manufacturers seem to be moving in the direction of offering these systems to drivers more and more. However as driving becomes more and more automated there tends to be a moving gap of acceptance and safety as drivers have to learn to operate and understand these systems and limitations. As such driving does improve with automation within the confines of the systems limitations. Outside of these limitations driving performance can degrade for a critical amount of time, but with education and awareness of system limitations this gap may be minimised. As such we tend to trend towards fully automated systems where the system is inherently more capable than the driver and hence driving performance improves with automation, but with a moving gap of driver-system interface.\r\n\r\n## References:\r\n\r\nCarsten, O., Lai, F.

The route needs to be named using a keyword argument, but then the rest is much the same.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom bottle import route, redirect, url\r\n\r\n@route('/', name='home')\r\ndef root():\r\n    return 'home'\r\n\r\n@route('/redirected')\r\ndef redirected():\r\n    return redirect(url('home'))\r\n```","data":{"title":"Bottle URL Redirect","slug":"bottle_url","layout":"simple_page","date":"23/05/2017","teaser":"The little documented url method in bottle.py"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","path":"blog/bottle_url.md"},{"content":"\r\nFor my own purposes I wanted to do some analysis of the Code of Points and I had little option but to scrape the important information from the current MAG Code of Points PDF file. I appreciate that the Code is now freely available online however if one wants to do any sort of analysis of the Code the PDF format is one of the more annoying formats to work with. As such I've made my scraping efforts available on [github](https://github.com/lukewiwa/code_of_points_MAG_2020) to anyone who would like to download it or make changes.\r\n\r\nOn that note I truly think that the FIG needs to consider making the Code of Points available in a machine readable format. Nowadays more and more of the community is starting to make efforts moving gymnastics and the Code of Points into the digital age. Having the FIG provide that data in a digital friendly format is a great first step into allowing the community to engage more and create interesting things with the data. To be clear when I say machine readable format that can be done in any number of ways. Whether it's simply a csv file published in tandem with the pdf or a fully fledged public API I don't honestly care, as long as it can be consumed and manipulated quickly.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this the way that most people will read the Code nowadays is on a digital device of some kind. I'd personally prefer a format which is responsive to the device you are reading it on. PDF does not lend itself well to this use case.\r\n\r\nA few fun things I've done with the data can be found at my [gymnastics](/gymnastics) page.\r\n\r\n\r\n","data":{"title":"The Code Of Points Format","slug":"machine_readable_code","layout":"simple_page","date":"08/04/2017","teaser":"The format of the Code of Points needs to be published in better more modern formats."},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","path":"blog/machine_readable_code.md"},{"content":"\r\nI have tried a few different iterations of personal websites and of online publishing in the past.

There is of course one solution to this problem which has not been talked about, although it appears to perhaps to be the most logical. **Abolish all gymnastics teams**. Get rid of them. Really reform the system. This is a radical solution I’ll admit but let me outline some reasons as to why this option may actually be very appealing.\r\n\r\n1. Gymnastics team events are essentially shoehorning an individual event into a team format. Gymnastics is not basketball, volleyball or football, it’s not a sport which requires two teams face each other. The sport can’t even pretend to be a team sport like relay events in swimming or athletics where individual athletes do their individual performance directly after each other. Stop pretending gymnastics is something that it’s not.\r\n\r\n2. We should keep in mind team event rules change all the time, even within the same competition (hello team final vs qualification). How are we to take the team competition seriously when the teams that make the team final do so under different rules compared to the ones they follow competing in the final. Team numbers have been diminishing from 7 members to 6 to 5 and now 4 in the next cycle. Some events, such as the European Games, have experimented with 3 member teams.  The logical conclusion is not hard to see in the distance. 1 member teams!\r\n\r\n3. We don’t see the best gymnasts make it to the Olympics currently. The current team qualification system is a large reason why this is not the case. We get gymnasts that fit the small teams of countries under the arbitrary rules that competition decides on. Sometimes even the best gymnasts in the country can miss out on selection for their own team due to strange team structures. Which brings me to my next point.\r\n\r\n4. Given this massive reform this would open up many spots at the Olympics and other events for those who are competitive and deserve to contest at these major competitions. Now I have no huge ideas on the specifics of how to pick the competitors but the numbers would open up room to explore radical new options rather than the tinkering around the edges we see now.\r\n\r\nIn essence the gymnastics community has been asking itself the wrong questions and we really need to take a hard look at ourselves and decide what we really want from gymnastics in the long term. Granted it takes two medals away from the Olympic Games events but if we really want to be honest with ourselves as a community we should stop beating around the bush and tackle this issue head on.","data":{"title":"The Case Against Gymnastics Teams","slug":"gymnastics_teams_suck","layout":"simple_page","date":"03/03/2017","teaser":"There has been plenty of debate about the new team format for the current cycle and, as usual, nobody is happy.

The Code has been a living and morphing document since it’s inception. This needn’t change, however the way in which we go about modifications has to become a more data driven process.\r\n\r\nI have been attending athletes meetings at every World Championships since 2011 and I can say they it has been important and useful method to communicate ideas and feedback between the athletes and the FIG about many issues. The consultations last year concerning the new code changes, however, were underwhelming and it has taken me a long time to really unpack why that was. To be clear these are criticisms about the process of the Code review rather than criticisms of the final draft.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Show Me The Data\r\n\r\nThe biggest change proposed for the upcoming MAG code was the move from 10 to 8 counting skills. There were of course other changes put forward but for the purposes of this discussion I will focus on this issue. This was extensively discussed and **the general consensus was that it would make gymnastics more forgiving on the body, it would possibly improve the overall quality of competitions (especially if gymnasts can discard that one problem skill) and raise the base level of gymnasts.** There was one thing that really bugged me though and so I asked a question:\r\n\r\n> Is there any evidence for these claims?\r\n\r\nThe reaction was mostly shrugged shoulders. The FIG and the Men’s Technical Committee (MTC) have a responsibility to provide the best arguments for and against any Code modifications and on this occasion it didn’t feel like this was the case.\r\n\r\nA change from 10 to 8 counting skills is not without precedent, The WAG code has been operating with 8 counting skills this Olympic cycle. This should provide a great opportunity to do some real data analysis on some of these claims. Here are just some examples that I thought about off the top of my head that could help with justifying the arguments for Code changes either way.\r\n\r\n## Injury Frequency\r\n\r\nI don’t know what data is collected by the FIG but I have heard they have made an effort recently in collating data for injuries during competition. A demonstration of injury frequency before and after the change for the WAG code could be an invaluable statistic. Now many factors need to line up to correctly obtain this data. The National medical teams need to be willing to participate, reporting of injuries needs to be consistent across the board and the FIG need to collate and analyse this data in a meaningful way. However if this is going to be an argument for modifications based on injury rates these kind of statistics are surely an integral part of that argument.\r\n\r\n## Average Execution Deductions\r\n\r\nTo justify whether less counting skills translates to an increase in skill quality we could take execution scores across various competitions and find the average execution deduction per skill before and after the WAG code changes. This eliminates the bias towards 8 counting skills having a higher execution score as would happen if the analysis were to be done per routine.\r\n\r\nA more basic measure would be to calculate the rate of falls per routine or per skill to see whether, on average, 8 counting skills correlates with less falls. These kind of statistics would, at the least, provide some evidence to support arguments concerning the quality of routines after the changes.\r\n\r\n## Average Participation Age\r\n\r\nHas the average or median participant age increased for major competitions around the World? If longevity is an argument then this may be borne out in the statistics themselves. _There are problems, however with this as the minimum age restriction got bumped up to 18 for WAG recently_ **Update: I have been reminded this was only on the MAG side.** Not an insurmountable problem however for statisticians.\r\n\r\n## Single Data Point Arguments\r\n\r\nI’ve heard through the grapevine that a justification for keeping with 10 counting skills was put forward because of the unique situation at Glasgow World Championships where Uneven Bars had a four way tie for first place. The argument follows that this would not happen in a 10 counting skill system. Now this argument could easily be backed up with a little data analysis. Have we had a sudden increase in tie situations in WAG competitions since the introduction of 8 counting skills? This would be fairly easy to justify either way by simply checking back on major competitions and comparing the rate of tied scores before and after the change. **One data point does not an argument make**.\r\n\r\n# Conclusions\r\n\r\nWithout any analysis no real conclusions can be drawn. I’m sure there are many ways to manipulate the data. There are also many smarter people out there who could get more out of the data than I ever could and the FIG and MTC should be embracing these possibilities. I for one would be happy to stay with 10 counting skills or move to 8 if there was something, anything, concrete the FIG and MTC could hang their hat on but so far I am left underwhelmed. Who knows, perhaps some analysis has been done and I am ignorant of it, if so feel free to point me towards it. I really hope that I am wrong.","data":{"title":"The “We Say You Do” Model Of Code Review Is Broken","slug":"broken_code_review","layout":"simple_page","date":"24/02/2016","teaser":"With the review and rehash of the Code of Points for the 2017–2020 cycle one thing is becoming increasingly clear, the FIG and requisite technical committees should do as students are told to do and show their working.
