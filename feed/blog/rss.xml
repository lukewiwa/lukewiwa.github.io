            <description><![CDATA[With the review and rehash of the Code of Points for the 2017–2020 cycle one thing is becoming increasingly clear, the FIG and requisite technical committees should do as students are told to do and show their working.

            <description><![CDATA[My siblings and I, when growing up, had a VHS tape of Pinocchio which we would watch on occasion.

            <description><![CDATA[My previous attempts at using python for plotting saw me use the massive and widely used library of Matplotlib.
