            "text": "With the upcoming review and rehash of the Code of Points for the 2017–2020 cycle one thing is becoming increasingly clear, the FIG and requisite technical committees should do as students are told to do and show their working. The Code has been a living and morphing document since it’s inception. This needn’t change, however the way in which we go about modifications has to become a more data driven process. I have been attending athletes meetings at every World Championships since 2011 and I can say they it has been important and useful method to communicate ideas and feedback between the athletes and the FIG about many issues. The consultations last year concerning the new code changes, however, were underwhelming and it has taken me a long time to really unpack why that was. To be clear these are criticisms about the process of the Code review rather than criticisms of the final draft. Show Me The Data The biggest change proposed for the upcoming MAG code was the move from 10 to 8 counting skills. There were of course other changes put forward but for the purposes of this discussion I will focus on this issue. This was extensively discussed and the general consensus was that it would make gymnastics more forgiving on the body, it would possibly improve the overall quality of competitions (especially if gymnasts can discard that one problem skill) and raise the base level of gymnasts. There was one thing that really bugged me though and so I asked a question: Is there any evidence for these claims? The reaction was mostly shrugged shoulders. The FIG and the Men’s Technical Committee (MTC) have a responsibility to provide the best arguments for and against any Code modifications and on this occasion it didn’t feel like this was the case. A change from 10 to 8 counting skills is not without precedent, The WAG code has been operating with 8 counting skills this Olympic cycle. This should provide a great opportunity to do some real data analysis on some of these claims. Here are just some examples that I thought about off the top of my head that could help with justifying the arguments for Code changes either way. Injury Frequency I don’t know what data is collected by the FIG but I have heard they have made an effort recently in collating data for injuries during competition. A demonstration of injury frequency before and after the change for the WAG code could be an invaluable statistic. Now many factors need to line up to correctly obtain this data. The National medical teams need to be willing to participate, reporting of injuries needs to be consistent across the board and the FIG need to collate and analyse this data in a meaningful way. However if this is going to be an argument for modifications based on injury rates these kind of statistics are surely an integral part of that argument. Average Execution Deductions To justify whether less counting skills translates to an increase in skill quality we could take execution scores across various competitions and find the average execution deduction per skill before and after the WAG code changes. This eliminates the bias towards 8 counting skills having a higher execution score as would happen if the analysis were to be done per routine. A more basic measure would be to calculate the rate of falls per routine or per skill to see whether, on average, 8 counting skills correlates with less falls. These kind of statistics would, at the least, provide some evidence to support arguments concerning the quality of routines after the changes. Average Participation Age Has the average or median participant age increased for major competitions around the World? If longevity is an argument then this may be borne out in the statistics themselves. There are problems, however with this as the minimum age restriction got bumped up to 18 for WAG recently Update: I have been reminded this was only on the MAG side. Not an insurmountable problem however for statisticians. Single Data Point Arguments I’ve heard through the grapevine that a justification for keeping with 10 counting skills was put forward because of the unique situation at Glasgow World Championships where Uneven Bars had a four way tie for first place. The argument follows that this would not happen in a 10 counting skill system. Now this argument could easily be backed up with a little data analysis. Have we had a sudden increase in tie situations in WAG competitions since the introduction of 8 counting skills? This would be fairly easy to justify either way by simply checking back on major competitions and comparing the rate of tied scores before and after the change. One data point does not an argument make . Conclusions Without any analysis no real conclusions can be drawn. I’m sure there are many ways to manipulate the data. There are also many smarter people out there who could get more out of the data than I ever could and the FIG and MTC should be embracing these possibilities. I for one would be happy to stay with 10 counting skills or move to 8 if there was something, anything, concrete the FIG and MTC could hang their hat on but so far I am left underwhelmed. Who knows, perhaps some analysis has been done and I am ignorant of it, if so feel free to point me towards it. I really hope that I am wrong.",

            "text": "The Code of Points for the 2020 Olympic cycle is official. The time has come to make some wild speculations about the consequences of these code changes. I decided to map the distribution of skills across value and element groups using a heatmap type graph. Not extremely complex but enough to get an idea of where skills are concentrated in certain values and element groups. The darker the colour, the more occurrences of that skill. To see more varied and, in my opinion, interesting routines I’m willing to speculate we need two things from these graphs: A concentrated distribution at and above values of C, since most routines will be made up by these skills. A more uniform distribution across element groups, since this will encourage variety with lots of skills to choose from.

My predictions looking at these charts are: Floor will be tend towards similarity as there are few skills to choose. Routines will trend towards the same skills and combinations in slightly varying order. Pommel and Rings routines may have some difference and flair with a good number of skills available to construct differing combinations. Although in saying that there will be a core set of skills which almost all routines will contain. Parallel Bars and Horizontal Bar will be where we see the most variety in routine construction with a large range of skills on offer over different element groups.

            "text": "For my own purposes I wanted to do some analysis of the Code of Points and I had little option but to scrape the important information from the current MAG Code of Points PDF file. I appreciate that the Code is now freely available online however if one wants to do any sort of analysis of the Code the PDF format is one of the more annoying formats to work with. As such I've made my scraping efforts available on github to anyone who would like to download it or make changes. On that note I truly think that the FIG needs to consider making the Code of Points available in a machine readable format. Nowadays more and more of the community is starting to make efforts moving gymnastics and the Code of Points into the digital age. Having the FIG provide that data in a digital friendly format is a great first step into allowing the community to engage more and create interesting things with the data. To be clear when I say machine readable format that can be done in any number of ways. Whether it's simply a csv file published in tandem with the pdf or a fully fledged public API I don't honestly care, as long as it can be consumed and manipulated quickly. In addition to this the way that most people will read the Code nowadays is on a digital device of some kind. I'd personally prefer a format which is responsive to the device you are reading it on. PDF does not lend itself well to this use case. A few fun things I've done with the data can be found at my Code Of Points page.",

            "text": "My previous attempts at using python for plotting saw me use the massive and widely used library of Matplotlib . I managed to produce some workable plots which I exported to jpeg and used on one of my medium articles . Although extremely customisable and functional I began the search for a plotting library with a nicer API that would export to more web friendly formats such as html and SVG. After some searching I stumbled upon toyplot which I've been quite happy with. I went ahead and updated the plots from my medium article using the library and uploaded the results to where I've mirrored that medium article here The 2020 Code of Points: What we might expect . The format options are various but I decided to export to an html/css/js format and simply copied and pasted into my static site generator. The API is quite straight forward, it boils down to a single Canvas object which you can then add different attributes to. It's a nice way to block together the things you want. It doesn't seem to have hard opinions about what plot you are building to begin with which for me is nice as it generalises my code across different graph types. You tend to always begin the same way. Here's a quick snippet of the heat map plots I produced with it. import pandas as pd import toyplot import toyplot.html # initialise a pandas dataframe of the code of points with open ( csv , 'r' ) as f : data = pd . read_csv ( f ) # Produce heat map matrix. I chose Rings app_name = 'Rings' matrix = pd . crosstab ( data [ data . app == app_name ] . value , data . eg , ) # Some variables to make the plot pretty domain_min = matrix . values . min () domain_max = matrix . values . max () tlocator = toyplot . locator . Explicit ( labels = list ( matrix )) llocator = toyplot . locator . Explicit ( labels = list ( matrix . index )) width = 500 height = 600 label = app_name tlabel = \"Element Group\" llabel = \"Value\" colormap = toyplot . color . brewer . map ( \"Greens\" , reverse = True , domain_min = domain_min , domain_max = domain_max , ) # initialise the Canvas object with variables above app_canvas , app_table = toyplot . matrix ( ( matrix , colormap ), tlocator = tlocator , llocator = llocator , width = width , height = height , label = label , tlabel = tlabel , llabel = llabel , ) # Clean up the Canvas, give it a name and render in html app_table . body . grid . hlines [[ 0 , - 1 ], ... ] = \"single\" app_table . body . grid . vlines [ ... ,[ 0 , - 1 ]] = \"single\" plot_name = \"{}.html\" . format ( app_name ) toyplot . html . render ( app_canvas , plot_name , ) The output is a rather nice looking plot based on html, css and javascript.

            "text": "There has been plenty of debate about the new team format for the current cycle and, as usual, nobody is happy. There is of course one solution to this problem which has not been talked about, although it appears to perhaps to be the most logical. Abolish all gymnastics teams . Get rid of them. Really reform the system. This is a radical solution I’ll admit but let me outline some reasons as to why this option may actually be very appealing. Gymnastics team events are essentially shoehorning an individual event into a team format. Gymnastics is not basketball, volleyball or football, it’s not a sport which requires two teams face each other. The sport can’t even pretend to be a team sport like relay events in swimming or athletics where individual athletes do their individual performance directly after each other. Stop pretending gymnastics is something that it’s not. We should keep in mind team event rules change all the time, even within the same competition (hello team final vs qualification). How are we to take the team competition seriously when the teams that make the team final do so under different rules compared to the ones they follow competing in the final. Team numbers have been diminishing from 7 members to 6 to 5 and now 4 in the next cycle. Some events, such as the European Games, have experimented with 3 member teams.  The logical conclusion is not hard to see in the distance. 1 member teams! We don’t see the best gymnasts make it to the Olympics currently. The current team qualification system is a large reason why this is not the case. We get gymnasts that fit the small teams of countries under the arbitrary rules that competition decides on. Sometimes even the best gymnasts in the country can miss out on selection for their own team due to strange team structures. Which brings me to my next point. Given this massive reform this would open up many spots at the Olympics and other events for those who are competitive and deserve to contest at these major competitions. Now I have no huge ideas on the specifics of how to pick the competitors but the numbers would open up room to explore radical new options rather than the tinkering around the edges we see now. In essence the gymnastics community has been asking itself the wrong questions and we really need to take a hard look at ourselves and decide what we really want from gymnastics in the long term. Granted it takes two medals away from the Olympic Games events but if we really want to be honest with ourselves as a community we should stop beating around the bush and tackle this issue head on.",

I decided to use the Bottle framework as opposed to Flask since I've always liked the lightness of Bottle and my little app has no need for scaling. Flask and Bottle seem have much the same features but there's one pattern in particular that is done easily in Flask but wasn't obvious in Bottle. In many flask tutorials a simple redirect to a url, usually after an authentication seems easily done. In Flask it's basically implemented like this: from flask import route , redirect , url_for @route ( '/' ) def root (): return 'home' @route ( '/redirected' ) def redirected (): return redirect ( url_for ( 'root' )) In Bottle this can be done with the little documented url method, however it works a little bit differently. The route needs to be named using a keyword argument, but then the rest is much the same. from bottle import route , redirect , url @route ( '/' , name = 'home' ) def root (): return 'home' @route ( '/redirected' ) def redirected (): return redirect ( url ( 'home' ))",
